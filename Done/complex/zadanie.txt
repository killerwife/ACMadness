  Complex, difficult and complicated 
Complex numbers are not only complex, but also complicated. So you would better try to solve another problem...


We have a complex number, a + b * i, where i is the square root of -1. We want to make it simple (I mean, real), by raising it to a natural power. For example, complex number 2 + 2 * i, can be made simple by raising it to 4:

(2 + 2 * i)4 = - 64
You have to compute the smallest natural number, N, (zero is not included) such that (a + b * i)N is a real number. Besides, we require that the absolute value of (a + b * i)N is not bigger than 230.

Input 

The first line of the input contains an integer M, indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, there is a line with two integers a and b. a is the real part of the complex number, and b is the imaginary part.

You can assume that -10000$ \le$a$ \le$10000, and -10000$ \le$b$ \le$10000.

Output 

For each test case, the output should consist of a single positive natural number N in one line, indicating the power such that (a + b * i)N is real and its absolute value is not greater than 230. If there is no solution, you have to output ``TOO COMPLICATED".
